The Very Best Team - COVID-19 Overview Dashboard Project Plan

1) covid19_summary
Choose countries (high spread, low spread, high mortality, low mortality); around 3 from each group, list has 12 total - Vian 
https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data

a) Sorta EDA moment - total global cases and total global deaths (for the dashboard) 

b) Do we need to rename the names (ie. CÔøΩte d'Ivoire)?

c) Create a subset of COVID dataset to include necessary variables such as Name, Who.Region, Cases...cumulative.total.per.100000.population, and Deaths...cumulative.total.per.100000.population and rename the variables

d) Select three countries from the top 10 countries with the highest number of total cases per 100K population (high spread countries).

e) Select three other countries where number of total cases per 100K population is less than 10,000 (low spread countries).

f) Select three countries from the top 10 countries with the highest number of total deaths per 100K population (high mortality countries)

g) Select three other countries where number of total deaths per 100K population is less than 250 (low mortality countries)

Maybe display it as graphs of the 3 choices and their respective cumulative case/death score?

2) socioeconomic_indicators - Bilal

a) Obtain primary and additional socioeconomic indicators from API

b) GDP, GNI (Economy), education, health (People), poverty, GINI index

3) peak_pandemic - Tenzin

a) Calculate prevalence, case fatality rate, and mortality rate

4) statistical_analysis - Bilal, Tenzin

a) Thresholds for socioeconomic indicators

b) Single out one indicator that is the best indicators 

c) run some quick and dirty analysis on all your indicators to figure out which one looks the strongest

d) ANOVA

e) Regression and p value

f) Correlation  

5) dashboard_creation - Vian, Trinley
