Good work guys!

Technically everything looks great.

I like the visuals for country groups on the first page. It would be
great if you;
  a) Color coded selected countries
  b) Kept the country colors consistent across all visuals, and
  b) Added a color legend on every page.
  
Having too many groups may have affected your ANOVA results. You may see
better outcomes if you try low-medium-high groupings.

This was a lot in a short time and you did good. I still suggest you work a bit
on your story-telling skills.

Thank you!
